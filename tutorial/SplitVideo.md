# Python Video Processing
##Step 1
###Using FFMPEG to Convert Video to Images

In order to work on video in Python, you must first convert your video file into a series of image files. Each image will be a single frame of the video. We will use FFMPEG to do this.

`FFMPEG is a command line tool`

```bash
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
